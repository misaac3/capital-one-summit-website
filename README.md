Github hosted site for Capital One Summit Coding Challange

This is my repository for the Captial One Summit Coding Challange.
The objective is:

"To solve this challenge, build a web application that provides the following functionality:

    1.) Visualize the data: Graph some (any 3) interesting metrics, maps, or trends from the dataset.
    2.) Price estimation: Given the geo-location (latitude and longitude) of a new property,
        estimate the weekly average income the homeowner can make with Airbnb.
    3.) Bookings optimization: Given the geo-location (latitude and longitude) of a property,
        what is the ideal price per night that will yield maximum bookings."
       
My plan is to use the JavaScript plot.ly API to graph the data from the given csv files.

With python, I will use the csv and json libraries to parse the data and output into a JSON file
to be used in the web application.
